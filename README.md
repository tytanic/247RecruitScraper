# 247RecruitScraper

Very simple html file which calls some functions to scrape the 247 html for recruit data, and prints to the console in JSON format.

Currently a very manual process, as I take the JSON, convert it to CSV, and then upload to Google Sheets to create color-coded spreadsheets.

I also have to update scraper.js any time I want to update the recruiting year, team, or conference that I'm scraping, so looking to make that a bit more dynamic.
